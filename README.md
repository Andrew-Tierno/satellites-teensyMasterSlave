# satellites-teensyMasterSlave

Current setup as of 8/8:

loader.py: programs platformio slave mode onto teensy and opens serial port
make: opens master mode serial and reads in commands to send

SPI0: interrupt-based adc read. 4 kHz, 4 channels per read, 32 bit per channel.
- 4 independent adc -> individual mux using chip selects
- Shared capture sample pin, set to 4kHz with pwm
- SPI register read 16 bits at a time

SPI1: dma-based slave mode communications.
- Master sends fixed-length command with header/footer/checksum, slave sends variable-length response
- Chip select must cycle between commands
- Interrupts on command read and response sent

SPI2: interrupt-based writes to the high-voltage mirror driver

Slave can handle continuous sampling indefinitely, with some hiccups after long operation
uint32s for telemetry overflow long-term logging (1 hour), but the payload should not be powered on for longer than a few minutes.
The overflow doesn't cause any internal error

Common functions:
- setup() functions are called once upon initialization
- enter() and leave() functions are called before entering and after exiting a state when commanded by the host
- Heartbeat() functions print internal telemetry at regular intervals (<= 1Hz) for debugging

* Known issues:

Small spi words not getting cleared on chip select low?

Interrupt speed for chip select low

Master must clock out extra spi words for response sent interrupt to fire
